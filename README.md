## flexible estimation of population size collected under removal experiments


### Intro
The removal can be permanent (individuals never return to the environment) or temporal (individuals are released back to the environment.)

While models have been discussed in the past (Otis et al 1987), there has been little to no attention to this family of models until recently. The need to remove endangered species in the uk, but also the need to offer robust inference. Including removal of alien or invasive species

While we don't advocate the use of removal experiments, there are circumstances were they may be used, like for disease surveillance. 

Eficient disease surveillance requires specific ammounts of samples, depending on the size of the population of interest. To acomplish it, field teams net to know the population size while they are sampling it. So, we offer here a set of tools in an simplified R package and shiny app that can be run every day after sample collection

Simplest methods like Moran-Zippin (Moran 1951, Zippin 1956, 1958).  an extreme model behaviour as suggested in Otis et al. (1978) or non spatial population size estimation using data augmentation.
